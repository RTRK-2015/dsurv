# NOP simulator
This project is an AWS-based cloud-optimized reverse- and forward-logistics utilizing simulator of the venerable x86 `nop` instruction. In keeping with the spirit of `python`, `AWS`, `node.js` (especially) and similar shennanigans, it is made up of a number of smaller equally useless projects. Aristotle once said: "The whole is more than the sum of its parts". He was wrong. The whole is equally useless as its parts.

## Server
The server project is supposed to be run on an EC2 instance. If you are feeling confused, continue. This is expected.

## Client
The client project is run from an old, boring desktop machine. Ignore it, as it is not cloud-based.

## Common
This project contains especially useless and exception-unsafe classes that both server and client projects use. Ignore this as well.

## Kickstarter
This is what you are looking for. With just one script, you can automatically launch an EC2 instance, an S3 bucket, an SQS queue and start wasting electricity immediately. Use wisely, that is to say, run it all the time.
